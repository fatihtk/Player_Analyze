# Player_Analyze

This project is based on visualization of shiny and google charts for the analysis of various categories of footballers based on their height and weight values. The methods used in this project can easily be used and edited in other projects.

**Creating R Application**
You have to run `Project_Codes.R` first. It could take some time to stract data from the website. Then you can use `Project_Server_and_ui.R` file with a map visualition or you can run `server.r` and `ui.r` inside of Additional ui.r and server.R(Google Buble Chart) directory with a Goggle baloon visualization.
